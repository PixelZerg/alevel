## Information coding systems

- VDU = visual display unit. Aka a monitor
- ASCII = american standard code for information interchange
  - contained non printable characters, for controlling things (E.g: carriage return, etc)
- Unicode
  - Downfalls of ASCII
    - only provides 128 numeric values, 33 of which are reserved for special functions
    - many control codes obsolete
    - does not cater for many European langs, which have accented characters and special symbols
    - Asian langs
    - Inadequate as a universal standard for information interchange
  - Extends ASCII to include other langs, mathematical symbols, etc
  - UTF-16 uses 1-2 16-bit codes. 2^16 different codes per unit
  - UTF-32 uses 32 bit code units. 2^32 different codes per unit
  - UTF-8 uses 1-4 bytes to encode each of the 1,112,064 valid unicode code points.
    - the first 128 characters of unicode correspond 1:1 with ASCII, and are represented in exactly the same way (using 1 byte). Backwards compat
- Character code form of decimal digits
  - numbers are mapped to certain codes, as they are characters just like anything else.
- pure binary representation
  - when number itself actually encoded in binary

## Error Checking and Correction

- information may get corrupted in transmission - may cause errors
  - electrical interference
  - faulty hardware
- how prevent
  - extra info for use for error checking and correction
- Majority Voting
   - Each bit is time sent 3 times in a row
     - the bit is taken to be the one that appears the most
     - does not guarantee absolute reliability	
       - unlikely but all 3 might corrupted
       - prob can be minimised further by larger value for n
     - size increase, but not increase information = additional redundancy
- Parity bits
   - for even parity: an additional bit appended onto packet, such that there is an even number of 1s in the packet
     - for odd: same but enforce odd 1s in the packet
     - if odd number of bits flipped in transmission, the total number of bits in the packet will not be the decided parity, thus error detected
     - does not work for even number of flips
     - good for checking asynchronous serial transmission of data over short distances
     - not good for synchronous serial transmission over long distances
     - use of single parity bit is usually sufficient, though
       - except when circumstances dictate that full error-detection is required
     - for even parity, the parity bit can be calculated by XORing the bits together (because XOR does modulo-2 addition)
       - e.g: for **0101**: **0** xor **1** = 1 xor **0** = 1 xor **1** = 0 <-- parity bit
     - for odd parity, same method can be used but negated at the end.
- Checksums
   - checking applied to block of data
   - data treated as fixed size numbers (e.g each one byte in size)
   - numbers then added together (in some way) to form some total
   - sum truncated to size of byte, often by hashing
   - truncated total is known as the checksum
   - checksum appended end of block
     - aka block character
   - receiver regenerates checksum and compares
- Checksum - LRC = longitudinal redundancy check
  - checksum  made up of parity bit for each column
  - by using this in conjunction of horizontal parity bits as well, some of the errors can be located and corrected
- Check digits
  - special cases of checksums 
  - operates on decimal numbers
  - an additional digit calculated using a standard algorithm
    - can therefore be verified for mistakes by regenerating digit using algorithm
  - try to detect the errors:
    - corrupted digit
    - transposition of digit
  - usually use modular arithmetic
- Basic Check Digit
  - given a number $$N$$ made up of digits $$d_1, d_2, ...$$
  - check digit $$C$$ calculated by solving $$(C+d_1+d_2+...)\mod p=0$$, choosing an appropriate value for p
  - $$\implies (C+d_1+d_2+...)$$ must be a multiple of $$p$$
  - therefore, let $$S=(d_1+d_2+...) mod p$$, then using the fact that $$C$$ is restricted to $$0$$ to $$p-1$$
  - $$C+S=p$$.
  - $$C=p-S$$.
