- sequencing = code executed in right order
  - wrong, missed out, wrong order instructions = bad
- assignment = give value to variable *(or constant)*
  - NB: constants should never change their value, so the value they are initialised with is the only time their values are set. Markscheme calls this 'declaration'. Therefore, constants can only have values assigned once, and that is assignment is in the declaration.
- [nested] selection = code run selectively (dependant upon condition)
- [nested] iteration
  - definitive = number of iterations is known prior to loop's runtime and is imperated (adhered to)<sup>[refining needed]</sup>
  - indefinite = iteration continues until a condition is met
    - E.g: Repeat..Until, While
