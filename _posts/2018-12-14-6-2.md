title: 6.2 - Classification of Programming Languages
---

- Low-level programming languages
  - machine code
    - language consisting of bit patterns/binary codes
    - referred to as executable binary codes
    - machine code instruction = operation which machine capable of carrying out
    - higher level operations with no direct machine counterpart must be broken down into a sequence of machine code instructions
    - machine code program = program consisting of executable binary codes
  - assembly language
    - symbolic name assigned to each operation/instruction code in machine language
    - called mnemonic (or memory jogger)
    - one-to-one mapping between assembly code and machine code
    - translated with assembler
- High-level programming languages
  - closer to English than to machine language
  - programmers can focus more on problem, leave translating to machine code to the computer
  - one-to-many mapping
