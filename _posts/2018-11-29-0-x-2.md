# Computer Science in Action

## Browsing the World with Computer Vision - Tushar Sharma
- Blippar
- Zeg.ai

  - gen 3d models of shoes, furniture, etc
- aspects:
  - text = NLP
  - finance, forecast, etc = big data
  - visual = computer vision
- Classification (visual)
- Blipper video
  - understand environment of images that are taken
  - augmented reality
- Key challenges
  - 3D geometry
  - how far away (location of camera)
  - orientation
  - camera not being held steady/cam quality
- Lighting w/Augmented Reality
  - model texturing:
    - map texture to shape
    - lighting changes appearance
  - in aug real, may not match lighting of room = may look out of place
    - developing systems to try match ambient lighting
- Datasets
  - annotated datasets
  - want variation in dataset
    - weather conditions
    - orientations
- Use cases Deep Learning
  - classify cars
    - parking lot analysis
      - cater products sold in shops (petrol station) to customers
    - understand efficiency of cars, emission levels
  - insurance
    - atm needs physical presence
    - https://tractable.ai/
    - help fill in forms (model, etc) after taking pic of car
- Supervised learning
  - performance - comparison to human
  - cloud API
    - like black box
    - cross platform
- Architectures

  - Convolutional neural network
- Data challenges
  - no landmarks to accuracy (%)
    - 1k -> 96.86%
    - 2k -> 97.23%
    - 3k -> 97.43%
- Modular network approach
  - split photo into easy objects (car, etc)
    - send car to other network for further identification (model, etc) using API
  - EID-CR-11.12 ebay car dataset
- More use cases
  - Toy which has camera
    - child show it thing, it say what thing is
  - Outdoor & indoor localisation
    - indoor maps
      - mall
      - airport
    - augmented reality maps (arrows)
      - self driving cars
    - AR city
- Rendering
  - realistic
  - better opportunities in virtual that not possible irl:
    - sun in room
    - massive lens
- Learning resources
  - fast.ai
  - standford course on visual learning CS 231n
  - NVIDIA - fundamentals of deep learning for Computer Vision
- Ethics
  - important question to ask
  - face recog api
    - security improve by not cloud based (local net)
  - Taking jobs away?
    - too much work, not enough humans
    - make 3D things more accessible to average people
    - let artists focus on being creative

## Jaimi Anderson, Cybersecurity
- Digital forensics
  - HMRC statistics
  - what is it?
    - recovery and investigation of matewrial found in digital devidces

- What crimes = digital forensics
  - high tech cyber crimes
  - identity theft
  - traditional
    - money laundering, etc`
- collection equipment
  - traditional tools
  - documentation tools
  - dissasembly tools
    - take comps apart
  - packaging + transport
    - evidence bags
  - copying tools
    - cables, imaging software, etc
- Evidence sources
  - hard drives
    - documents
    - encrypted files
    - steganography
    - logs, config, cache
    - unallocated space

  - Networks
  - Portable Storage
  - periphals
    - photocopiers
    - modems
    - printers
  - telephony
  - anything with GPS, etc
- procedure
  - Assess
    - secure scene
    - protect perishables
    - identify connections
    - fingerprinting, interviews
    - document secure
  - Acquisition
    - copy
    - validate
    - verify
    - remove
  - when copy, prove exact copy - hashes
  - capture network packets
  - physical + logical extraction
    - physical = partition table analysis, etc
    - logical = filesystem analysis
- Applications used
  - FTK
  - X-Ways
  - NUIX
  - Encase
  - Exif
  - Cellebrite
- Deleted files
  - data still present
- Hidden files
  - magic numbers
  - bad sectors
  - alternate data streams
    - NTFS
- Steganography
  - sometimes used to supplement encryption
  - hiding stuff in images
- Cases
  - BTK killer
  - the corocorans
  - Kari Baker

  - envrionment issues
  - privacy issues
  - development in technology
- cases
  - cockroaches to find survivors after natural disaster
  - paralysed person move arm by thinking abt moving it
- exam tech
