title: 1.6 - OOP Concepts
---

## Terms

- Method = code or routines _(contained within a class)_
- information hiding = methods/props can only be accessed by certain classes
- Class = definition of the properties and methods _(of a group of similar objects)_
- Object = created from class; instance.
- property = class member for holding data
- inheritance = concept that properties and methods in one class can be shared with subclass.
- instantiation = creating an object from a class
- polymorphism = Methods overriden such that they are able to operate on differing underlying types of data.

## Stuff
- Modular design = breaks system into smaller units (modules)
  - advantages:
    - easy to amend: only affected module needs editing
    - easy add new functionality: new module
    - management: programmers can work independently on self-contained modules
    - objects inherit behaviors+attributes = reuse code = good
    - help avoid changes made to code producing inadvertant side-affects in other areas
    - libraries can be created: code reused easily
- Encapsulation = putting properties, methods and data in one object (data and code same object).
  - self-contained = reduce side affects/implications
- polymorphism = the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).
  - E.g: most languages, integers and floats are polymorphic - can add, subtract, etc regardless if types different.
