## Relationship between hardware and software

- hardware
  - physical components
  - electronic/electrical
  - platform on which software executes
- software
  - sequences of instructions (programs)
  - understood and executed by hardware (in its circuits or in VM equivalent)
- Classification of software
  - system programs = control the operation of the computer itself (OS)
  - application programs = solve problems for users
- System software
  - layer/layers of software to enable users to operate comp without having to be familiar with internal working. Layers = system software
    - includes operating system etc
- Application software
  - program/programs designed to support user-oriented tasks not specific to computers (e.g communicating, looking up info, etc)
  - cannot execute unless first translated into lang of computer = machine code or a form executable by a computer
  - needs to be loaded to main memory and must be able to communicate with IO devices or other computers
  - may need to access or store information
  - Types
    - General purpose application software
      - appropriate for many application areas
      - cheap = price spread over large customer base
      - reliable = test on large customer base + experienced team
    - Special purpose application software
      - software for a particular application
      - reliable = test on large but specialised customer base + experienced team
    - Bespoke software
      - software written from scratch for a certain task
      - made when no general purpose or special purpose software exists that could do the job
- System software
  - operating system sftware
    - controls the operation of a computer
  - utility programs
    - designed to perform a commonplace task
    - formatting, partitioning, defragmentation, etc
  - library programs
    - collection of compiled routines that other programs can link to and use
    - linking may be done at compile-time or run-time
    - loaded run-time libraries remain resident in memory until the last executing application is closed
    - Windows: dlls
  - Translators
    - Compiler
      - high-level lang to machine code or other lower-level lang
    - Assembler
      - symbolic form of machine code (assembly language) to machine code
    - Interpreter
      - translates and executes a high-level language or intermediate language one satement at a time
- Role of operating system
  - Hide complexities of hardware
    - machine easier to use
  - Manage hardware resources
    - controlled allcation of processors, memories, IO devices among the various programs competing for them
    - manage data storage
