title: 4.1 - Abstraction and Automation
---

- logical reasoning = to reach a conclusion or logical consequence from premises using deductive, inductive and/or abductive reasoning.
  - _Requires putting models into action to solve problems_
    - *create algorithm*
    - *implement algorithms in program code*
    - *implementing models in data structures*
    - *executing the code*
- problem solving = process of finding a solution
- automation = the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimum human assistance.
- abstraction
  - representational abstraction
    - unnecessary details removed (only info required to solve problem remains)
    - 'looking at the big picture'
  - abstraction by generalisation/categorisation = putting similar aspects of problem into hierarchal categories
    - procedural abstraction = solutions broken down into procedures or subroutines
    - functional abstraction =
