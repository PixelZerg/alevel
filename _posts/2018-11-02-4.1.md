- logical reasoning = to reach a conclusion or logical consequence from premises using deductive, inductive and/or abductive reasoning.
  - _Requires putting models into action to solve problems_
    - *create algorithm*
    - *implement algorithms in program code*
    - *implementing models in data structures*
    - *executing the code*
- logic
  - argument = actual statements
  - compound proposition: if X then Y
  - deduction
    - $P \implies Q$ = P implies Q
      - P is the hypothesis/antecedent/premise
      - Q is the conclusion/consequence
      - If P is true then Q is true.
    - argument form: $P \therefore Q$
    - Logical reasoning
      - if P then Q, if Q then R, therefore, if P then R
      - $P \implies Q, Q \implies R \vdash P \implies R$
  - induction
    - Netwon's Principle: Whatever is true of everything before our eyes is true of everthing in the universe.
    - Inductive reasoning kinda the opposite of deductive reasoning (look for rules from facts):
      - E.g: If John Smith is a footballer, then he wears football boots when playing football.
      - can then generalise using Newton's Principle:
      - If x is a footballer, then x wears football boots when playing football.
      - AKA: All footballers wear football boots when playing football.
- problem solving = process of finding a solution
- automation = the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimum human assistance.
- abstraction
  - representational abstraction
    - unnecessary details removed (only info required to solve problem remains)
    - 'looking at the big picture'
  - abstraction by generalisation/categorisation = putting similar aspects of problem into hierarchal categories
    - procedural abstraction = solutions broken down into procedures or subroutines
    - functional abstraction = breaking down a complex problem into reusable functions
