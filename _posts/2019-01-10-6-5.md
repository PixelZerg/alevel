title: 6.5 - Boolean Algebra
---

- like Maths Algebra - follow certain rules
- Boolean operators

  - $$+$$ addition: `OR`
  - $$\cdot$$ multiplaction: `AND`
  - $$\overline{}$$ overline: `NOT`. AKA: Inversion, complement, negation, etc
- NB: AND has greater precedence than OR

## Boolean Identities and Laws:

### Null Law

$$0A=0$$: Let's say whether I am allowed to eat things that are red is $$A$$ (yes/no). And whether I am able to eat ice cream is $$0$$ (= not allowed). Am I allowed to eat red ice-cream? No.

$$1+A=1$$. (Something that is always true) OR A. Here, A is irrelevant, you don't even need to bother ORing. The answer is of course going to be true.

### Distributive Law

$$A(B+C)=AB+AC$$ makes sense in traditional algebra as well. $$A+BC=(A+B)(A+C)$$ is unique to boolean algebra though. Basically don't forget works with `+` operator too.

### Absorption Law

$$A(A+B)=A$$. If $$A$$ is true, the part inside the brackets are true as well. If $$A$$ is false, the expression, would be $$0(A+B)=0$$ (Null law). So clearly $$B$$ is irrelevant and the expression is equivalent to $$A$$.

$$A+AB=A$$: If $$A$$ is $$1$$, then since for `OR` gates, we only need one of the inputs to be true, the output is clearly $$1$$, without even having to think about the rest. If $$A$$ is $$0$$, since the output of an `AND` gate will always be $$0$$ if any of the inputs are $$0$$, we also know that the output will be $$0$$ without having to think any further. Evidently, $$A+AB=A$$

### De Morgan's Law

Might be tricky seeing how this scales up when you have multiple variables by just looking at it algebraically. I feel it is best expressed as an algorithm:

Consider an expression made out of smaller expressions (let's call them "smalls"), all with the same operator between them ($$\cdot$$ or $$+$$). E.g: for $$A+B+C$$, the smalls are $$A$$,$$B$$ and $$C$$ (and the operator is $$+$$).

1. NOT all smalls
2. Switch all operators
3. NOT the whole expression

Clarification: "switch all operators" means, replace all $$\cdot$$s with $$+$$ and $$+$$s with $$\cdot$$s.



## Caution with NOTs

**NOT(A AND B) is not (NOT A) AND (NOT B) !**


$$
\overline{AB}\neq\overline{A}\cdot\overline{B}
$$


If we take De Morgan's law and NOT both sides, we can actually see that:

$$
\overline{AB}=\overline{A}+\overline{B}
$$

Don't get mixed up!
