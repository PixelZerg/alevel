| Term           | Definition                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Memory         | Where instructions + data stored on computer                 |
| Algorithm      | **terminating** sequence of steps to complete a task         |
| Syntax         | Language: rules of how tokens are used                       |
| Memory Address | specific location in memory _where instructions or data are stored_ |
| Assignment | process of giving value to variable or constant |
| Constant | Item of data whose value does not change |
| Variable | item of data whose value can change at runtime |
| Debug | finding + correcting errors in programs |
| Declaration | defining variables/constants in terms of name + data type |
| Data type | determines what sort of data is being stored + how handle by program |
| Integer | A number with no fractional part. **Includes 0.**|
| Pointer | An object ('_data item_') that stores a memory address. |
| Array   | A data structure used for holding multiple **related** values/objects `elements` |
| Element | A value within an array or similar data structures - *aka members* |
| Record  | ~~*One line of text file*~~ Aka `struct`: A collection of `fields`, which may be of different types, (the types of which, often defined by a Record Declaration) |

## Declaration/Assignment

When they say "declaration" they mean stuff that looks like this:

```csharp
private const string SOME_COOL_IDENTIFIER = "hello";
```

```vb
Dim coolIdentifier As Integer = 5
```

```python
a = 5
```

They'll penalise if you mix this up with assignment, which looks like:

```vb
coolIdentifier = 5
```

```python
a = 5
```

## Record

Textbook says: _'One line of text file'_.

## Data Types

- integer
- real/float
- text/string
- boolean
- character
- date/time
- pointer/reference

## More Data Types Info

- Static Data Structures
  - fixed size. Amount of memory, once allocated, cannot change at runtime. (Fixed at design time/compile time)
- Dynamic Data Structures
  - can grow or shrink at runtime as needed to contain the data required to be stored
    - new storage in main memory can be allocated when needed/freed up when not needed
- Queue
  - ordered collection of items - First In First Out abstract data type
  - Front = head, other end = tail
  - Itms added to rear and removed from front
- Stack
  - ordered collection of items - Last In First Out abstract data type
  - Addition of new items and removal of existing items always takes place at the same end of the stack (known as the top)

## Why Meaningful Names

- _will help when tracing bugs_
- other programmers follow code
- naming convention = good practice
