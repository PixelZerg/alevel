title: 4.2 - Finite State Machines
---

- finite state machines = a way of representing a system using
  - set of states
  - transitions between states
  - inputs and outputs
  - = a machine of fixed possible states, set of allowable inputs (some of which can change the states) + set of outputs
- uses
  - modelling the design of things (compilers, network protocols, hardware)
  - FSMs' states all yes/no (1/0).
    - FSMs with output output 1/0
    - No output = internal state updated only = AKA **semiautomaton**
  - accepting state = states which cause FSM to indicate 1
  - FSMs with no outputs always have 1 or more accepting states

## Mathematical Definition
- deterministic finite automaton (DFA) = 5ple:
  - $\Q$ = finite. non-empty set of states
  - $\sigma$ = finite, non-empty input 'alphabet' (set of symbols)
  - $\delta$ = series of transition functions
  - $q_0$ = initial state, an element of $\Q$
  - $F$ = set of accepting states
  - must be exactly 1 function for every input symbol in $\sigma$ from each state
- non-determenistic finite automaton (NDFA or NFA)
  - same 5ple as above, hower, unlike DFAs, 
    - not required to have transition functions for every symbol in $\sigma$
    - multiple transition functions in same state for same symbol allowed
    - new thing: null transitions = $\epsilon$ = allow FSM to jump from one state to another without having to read a symbol
- Proven: DFAs can do everything NFAs can (and vice-versa). DFAs just might take more states+transitions

## Optimisation
- means finding machine with minimum no states that performs same function
- acyclic FSAs can be minimised $O(n)$


## FSM Diagrams
- circles = different states
- arrows = input value which correspond to the transitions between states
- two rings = accepting state

## Moore/Mealy Distinction
- in Mealy model, output is a function of present state + input, in Moore model, output is only function of only the present state
