title: 5.4 - Binary Number System

- Unsigned binary
  - limited to nonnegative values

  - Min and max values
    - range of numbers that can be encoded in unsigned binary depends upon no of bits allocated to represent the number
    - max: $2^n - 1$
    - min: 0
  - Binary arithmetic
    - adding two unsigned binary integers
      - Just like adding in base 10, but carries when gets after 1 (aka would be 2)

      - basic rules:
        - $0_2 + 0_2 = 0_2$
        - $0_2 + 1_2 = 1_2$
        - $1_2 + 0_2 = 1_2$
        - $1_2 + 1_2 = 0_2$, carry $1_2$
          - AKA: $1_2 + 1_2 = 10_2$
    - Binary multiplaction
      - Exactly what you would expect (aka: same as denary, but the addition thing at the end is subject to rules above)
