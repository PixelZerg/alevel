- Unsigned binary
  - limited to nonnegative values

  - Min and max values
    - range of numbers that can be encoded in unsigned binary depends upon no of bits allocated to represent the number
    - max: $$2^n - 1$$
    - min: 0
  - Binary arithmetic
    - adding two unsigned binary integers
      - Just like adding in base 10, but carries when gets after 1 (aka would be 2)

      - basic rules:
        - $$0_2 + 0_2 = 0_2$$.
        - $$0_2 + 1_2 = 1_2$$.
        - $$1_2 + 0_2 = 1_2$$.
        - $$1_2 + 1_2 = 0_2$$, carry $$1_2$$
          - AKA: $$1_2 + 1_2 = 10_2â€‹$$
    - Binary multiplaction
      - Exactly what you would expect (aka: same as denary, but the addition thing at the end is subject to rules above)

      - Note: if there is a situation where you have to do 1+1+1+1 in a column, you will have to carry to the _next next_ column because 1+1+1+1 = 100
- Two's complement
  - can represent negative integers

  - Facts independent of no of bits:
    - If most significant (first) bit is 1, then will be -ve, else +ve (or 0 if all 0).
    - lowest possible integer when most significant bit 1, and all else 0.
    - -1 is when all bits 1
    - highest possible integer is when most significant bit 0, and all else 1.
  - Observations:
    - say we have binary number representing $$n_{10}$$ of $$k_{10}$$ digits. To make a signed integer of $$(k+1)_{10}$$ digits of value $$-n_{10}$$, it is written as 1 prepended to $$2^k-n$$ when it is written in binary with $$k$$ digits
    - ![observation example](https://i.gyazo.com/987937ddb721ba8d33c32f0d3e673adc.png)
    - Above in other words: with $$k+1$$ digits, when counting from $$00...00_2$$ to $$01...11_2$$, you count from $$0$$ to $$+2^k -1$$, then when counting from $$10...00_2$$ to $$11...11_2$$, you count from $$-2^k$$ to $$-1$$.
      - When I say 'counting' here, I mean counting the last $$k$$ digits in the binary patterns
  - The weight of each bit is pow of 2, except for most significant bit, whose weight is negative of corresponding power of two/
  - Most significant bit sometimes AKA 'sign bit'
  - Converting:
    - Decimal to two's complement
      - If non-negative, just convert as if unsigned, but pad begining

      - if negative:
        - Method 1:
          - convert magnitude to binary as if unsigned
          - prepend 0
          - flip bits
          - add $$1_2$$
          - ![img](https://i.gyazo.com/8e9b4c81bb0e1db189d687bfeac61dd8.png)
        - Method 2:
          - convert magnitude to binary as if unsigned
          - prepend 0
          - flip all bits apart from the least significant bit
          - ![img](https://i.gyazo.com/16ace9658160f5675694b3ec7f4608ff.png)
    - Two's complement to decimal
      - same as converting binary to decimal, but remember that most significant bit's value is $$-2^n$$
  - Subtracting
    - can subtract B from A by negating B and adding to A.
    - $$A-B = A+(-B)$$.
    - E.g: $$0101_2 - 0011_2 = 0101_2 + (-0011_2) = 0101_2 + 1101_2 = (1)0010_2$$
    - if this results in a carry, it is ignored because we restrict answer to same numer of bytes started with
  - Why two's complement good
    - don't need seperate subtraction mechanism: just addition but with complement
      - the circuits for which are relatively simple
    - other representations have 2 different representations of 0, this only has 1. Useful because 0 is used heavily when checking for equality. I.e: $$A-B=0 \implies A=B$$
