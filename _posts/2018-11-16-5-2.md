- Number Base
  - specifies how many different digts used in constructing a numeral and by how much to multiply each digit
  - Decimal (Base 10)
    - Has 10 different digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Base is 10: $10^n$ where $n \in \Z$

  - Binary (Base 2)
    - Has two digits: 0,1. $2^n$ where $n \in \Z$

  - Hexadecimal (Base 16)
    - 16 digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. $16^n$ where $n \in \Z$

  - n (Base n)
    - some number $a$ in base $n$ represented as: $a_n$
- Decimal to Binary
  - Take the decimal number and repeatedly divide by 2 until 0 is reached, writing the remainder each time
  - Then read the remainders from the bottom to the top

- Decimal to Hexadecimal
  - Can use the succesive division method (see above), but this time, dividing by 16

- Hexadecimal to binary
  - Replace each hexadecimal digit by its binary equivalent (each should 4 bits)

  - Why
    - Hexadecimal digits (0-F) map to 0-15 in decimal, and this decimal range can be represented by exactly 4 binary digits
