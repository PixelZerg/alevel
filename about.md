Hello, I like Computer Science and have been making random stuff for the lolz for years and years and so know a thing or two when it comes to this kind of thing. You may be in a similar position too.

So yeah we know about Computer Science... nice. That's handy because knowledge about Computer Science directly leads to a high score in this AQA A Level Computer Science course.

Just kidding.

We might as well be Alan Turing himself or whatever but that doesn't automatically mean that we're gonna get a high score. If this suprises you then I really don't know what to say other than: good luck. Either way, the examiner looking at your papers, underpaid and probably miserable from marking 100s of scripts won't give a shit about how _amazing_ you are at Computer Science - they just want to tick things off and go home. If you haven't made this realisation yet then you'd better make it now: we're gonna want to _**maximise marks**_.

Knowledge of Computer Science is good - of course it's good. But maximising Computer Science knowledge != maximising score, unless we're talking about the knowledge of the mark scheme here as well. It's all about studying to the spec and saying exactly what they want us to.

This site is for **notes** while embarking on this beautiful, beautiful journey.

PS: Here is my [main site](https://makurell.github.io/) where I have other stuff other than school work.

Okay that's all, cya.
